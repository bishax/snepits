Snippets for stochasic epidemic household models.

**Apology from the author:**
This code was written many years ago just as I had discovered object oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

This was before I learned how to use it effectively, and before I developed a distaste for OOP and a preference for programming in a functional manner.
